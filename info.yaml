# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "Character ROM and bitmap shifter for POV displays"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "clock: clocks out character columns or shifts in data. Data is 8bits LSB first. write mode will write either into selected character face banks or string buffer if bank = b0000"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Reset counters with reset = 1 and one clock cycle. Shift in some 8 bit (LSB) ASCII string with io bank = 0b0000, write = 1, din = <string characters>. Set write = 0 and cycle with clock trough the character pixel columns of the string left to write. Using bank bits you can switch the ROM character faces by castom bitmaps. These are shifted in with the corresponding bank bits set. String buffer is is untouched in that case."

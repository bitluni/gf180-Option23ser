# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "Character ROM and bitmap shifter for POV displays"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "clock is used to shift-in in 64 ASCII characters (bank=0) or pixels(bank=1) in write mode. Or output 8x8 pixel characters (bank=0) or a 8x1024 pixel bitmap. msg 0 and msg 1 has to be 0."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Reset counters with reset = 1 and one clock cycle. Shift in some 8 bit (LSB) ASCII string with io bank = 0, write = 1, din = <string characters>. Set write = 0 and cycle with clock trough the character pixel columns of the string left to write. Using bank you can switch to graphics mode and shift-in 1024 columns of 8 pixels and output them later."
